鹿柴

空山不见人,
但闻人语响.
返景入深林,
复照青苔上.

This poem is the focus of *[19 Ways of Looking at Wang Wei](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Nineteen_Ways_of_Looking_at_Wang_Wei/3o75CwAAQBAJ?hl=en)*, a “classic study of translation” which compares how different translators have rendered 鹿柴. As an exploration in communication and poetry, I translated this and another poem, 月夜憶舍弟, into emoji.

月夜憶舍弟

戍鼓斷人行，邊秋一雁聲。
露從今夜白，月是故鄉明。
有弟皆分散，無家問死生。
寄書長不達，況乃未休兵。

When translating, I like to see a pretty translation and a gloss translation.

For 月夜憶舍弟, pretty translations came from David Hinton, Stephen Owen, Witter Bynner, and David Young. I sought out a gloss as well, at first in Google Translate (by gradually separating the characters from each other) and then in the <a href='https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=worddict&wdrst=1&wdqtm=0&wdqcham=1&wdqt=%E6%88%8D%E9%BC%93%E6%96%B7%E4%BA%BA%E8%A1%8C%EF%BC%8C%E9%82%8A%E7%A7%8B%E4%B8%80%E9%9B%81%E8%81%B2%E3%80%82%0D%0A%E9%9C%B2%E5%BE%9E%E4%BB%8A%E5%A4%9C%E7%99%BD%EF%BC%8C%E6%9C%88%E6%98%AF%E6%95%85%E9%84%89%E6%98%8E%E3%80%82%0D%0A%E6%9C%89%E5%BC%9F%E7%9A%86%E5%88%86%E6%95%A3%EF%BC%8C%E7%84%A1%E5%AE%B6%E5%95%8F%E6%AD%BB%E7%94%9F%E3%80%82%0D%0A%E5%AF%84%E6%9B%B8%E9%95%B7%E4%B8%8D%E9%81%94%EF%BC%8C%E6%B3%81%E4%B9%83%E6%9C%AA%E4%BC%91%E5%85%B5%E3%80%82'>MDBG Chinese Dictionary</a>.

Here's Google Translate version of 月夜憶舍弟, unadulterated, from January 2020.


> Drumming breaks the pedestrian, Bianqiu a wild goose.
> Lu Cong is white tonight, and the month is hometown.
> All the younger brothers were scattered, and the family asked about life and death.
> The length of the book to be sent was not reached, and the condition was not a truce.

Although it doesn’t capture the poetry or a good chunk of the meaning, look! There are no personal pronouns, unlike some human translations. I actually like the last couple of lines of this.

In my emoji translation, I have tried to take into account the character choice of the Mandarin and the [CLDR descriptions and text](https://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts-12.0/emoji-list.html) that accompanies emoji. This is in an effort to reflect the original beauty of Chinese and to create a translation that can be perceived similarly on different platforms. While I haven’t found a convenient way to view how my [emoji translation varies from platform to platform](http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html) (currently building this), I was amused by the differences between my phone and computer.

With 鹿柴 / 🦌🏞️, I glanced at the Google translation, but I found myself surprised that I could read it. Not perfectly, but the characters are simpler, within the grasp of someone who is roughly HSK 3.

Because of this ‘simplicity’, I decided to try to keep to the Chinese a little bit more, though the third line has some deviation from the original. I’d almost call it significant, but then I look at some of the poems in *19 Ways of Looking at Wang Wei* and think that it is hardly significant at all.
